# Comparing classic, deep and semi-supervised learning forwhole-transcriptome breast cancer subtyping
Gene expression levels, measuring the transcription activity, are widely used to predict abnormal gene activities, in particular for distinguishing between normal and tumor cells. This problem has been addressed by a variety of machine learning methods; more recently, this problem has been approached using deep learning methods, but they typically failed in meeting the same performance as machine learning. In this paper, we show specific deep learning methods that can achieve similar performance as the best machine learning methods.
